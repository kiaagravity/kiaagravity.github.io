## Prof. Weiwei Zhu (NAOC)

#### Pulsar and Fast Radio Burst study using FAST

Pulsars and Fast Radio Bursts (FRB) are some of the most energetic and "fast" objects in radio astronomy. They are both possibly from "neutron stars". In this talk, I will introduce some of my group and collaborators' pulsars and FRB research using the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST). I will talk about the discovery and timing of new pulsars, testing theories of gravitation using pulsar timing, and measuring pulsar emission and geometry. I will also talk about some of the FAST FRB key science project results, including the large sample repeating FRB studies and the radio follow-up of the Galactic FRB source -- SGR J1935+2154.
