## Group Meeting

**Chair**: Dr. Zhenwei Lyu (吕振伟)

Group meeting provides a friendly environment to interact with group members or
visiting scholars.  It also brings the opportunity to broaden views in science,
to learn different methods in solving problems, to strengthen the capability in
scientifically sound presentations, even to develop close collaborations via
inspiring discussions. 

- Our group meetings take place in the <b>Meeting Room in Auditorium</b>. To
avoid conflicts with students' classes, the time is fixed to <b>Sundays
9:00—12:00</b>.

- It is suggested to speak English whenever there are foreigners in the
audience. Otherwise it is suggested to talk in Chinese, but use English in
slides.
