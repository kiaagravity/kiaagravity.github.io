## One talk:

#### Jiahang Zhong: A 50s quasi-periodic oscillation in the early X-ray afterglow of GRB 220711B

Ref. 1: [Signature of a magnetar central engine with precession motion in the X-ray emission of GRB 220711B](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00284)

Ref. 2: [A 50s quasi-periodic oscillation in the early X-ray afterglow of GRB 220711B](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00278)

## Two rehearsals:

#### Zhihao Zheng: Inference of Love-Q relations with gravitational waves in hierarchical Bayesian framework

#### Jinghao Zhang: Lightcurve Features of Magnetar-Powered Superluminous Supernovae with Gravitational-Wave Emission and High-Energy Leakage
