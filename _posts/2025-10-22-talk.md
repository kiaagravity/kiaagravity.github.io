#### Binary neutron star mergers: from dynamical tides to postmerger oscillations and hydrodynamical instabilities

Binary neutron star mergers provide unique laboratories for probing dense matter. I will first discuss the dynamical tides of neutron stars, focusing on the roles of compositional stratification and solid components. I then examine mode excitations, their imprints on gravitational-wave phase shifts, and the shattering of the crust, which can release energy to power electromagnetic precursors. After the merger, the hot and rapidly rotating remnant undergoes violent oscillations; analyzing its hydrodynamics and radiation is crucial for constraining the hot equation of state. I will further explore how uncertainties in thermal heating influence gravitational waves and dynamical ejecta, and investigate whether hydrodynamical instabilities, such as convection and one-armed spiral modes, can develop in the remnant.
