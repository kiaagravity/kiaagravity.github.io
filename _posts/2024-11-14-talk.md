#### Rotating Black Holes: Understanding Their Shadows and Visual Features

Observations of rotating black holes, particularly through shadow images captured by instruments like the Event Horizon Telescope, reveal an asymmetrical shape that provides insights into the black hole’s spin, mass, and axis orientation. These observations not only deepen our understanding of black hole physics but also serve as one of the most rigorous tests of Einstein’s theory of general relativity. This talk will introduce foundational concepts in black hole physics, with a focus on rotating black holes. We will discuss the theoretical frameworks used to describe these objects and analyze photon motion in their vicinity. Additionally, the phenomenon of black hole shadows will be explored, offering insights into the complex interplay between light and gravity in these extreme cosmic environments.
