#### Wave Effects of Gravitational Waves

Wave effects are a crucial aspect of gravitational waves. When the wavelength of GWs is comparable to or greater than the Schwarzschild radius of an object, the propagation of gravitational waves no longer follows geometrical optics, and coherence and interference can occur. Despite their significance, studying these wave effects can be challenging due to their complexity.

In this talk, I will discuss numerical techniques for simulating these effects in the gravitational field of a Schwarzschild black hole. I will talk about the back-scattering effect of the interaction between GWs and the background curvature. Finally, I will discuss the potential detectability of these wave effects in aLIGO.
