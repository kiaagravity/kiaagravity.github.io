#### Gravitational wave astronomy: some investigations on binary neutron stars and supermassive binary black holes

Gravitational wave astronomy is revolutionizing our understanding of the Universe. Since the historic discovery of GW150914 in 2015, ground-based interferometers have discovered over 90 compact binary coalescence events. These events, lasting from fractions of seconds to minutes, include stellar-mass binary black holes, binary neutron stars and neutron star-black hole binaries. Meanwhile, pulsar timing arrays are being exploited to search for gravitational waves with periods of years to decades. After several decades of international efforts, we may be finally approaching the sensitivity to detect waves from supermassive binary black holes. In this talk, I will briefly summarize recent progresses and future prospects of gravitational wave astronomy on both short and long timescales, while focusing on the study of binary neutron stars and supermassive binary black holes.
