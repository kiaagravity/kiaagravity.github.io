#### Nano-Hz Gravitational Wave Astronomy: Its implications and promises

Maturing Pulsar Timing Arrays are poised to inaugurate the era of nano-hertz gravitational-wave astronomy, led by the coordinated efforts of the International Pulsar Timing Array (IPTA). The astrophysical and cosmological implications of current IPTA results will be summarisd. I will discuss ongoing efforts that should be helpful to pursue  persistent, multi-messenger GW astronomy with individual supermassive black-hole binaries like OJ 287 in the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) era. The need for an Asian initiative to build expertise in GW astronomy, strengthening regional capacity, training, and coordinated follow-up will be highlighted.
