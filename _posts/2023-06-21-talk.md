#### Neutron-Star Equation of States Probed by Clocked Bursters

Type-I X-ray bursts are rapidly brightening phenomena triggered by the nuclear burning of light elements near the surface of accreting neutron stars. So far, 115 X-ray bursters have been found by observations and show irregular behavior of light curves. However, some X-ray bursters are quite regular, i.e., constant recurrence time and constant shaper of light curves, and often called Clocked bursters, which are powerful sites to probe uncertainties of many model parameters such as accretion rate, the composition of accreted matter, reaction rates, neutron star structure, and temperature. In this study, we focus on the uncertainties of the equation of states, which determines the latter two properties. Based on our numerical models covering whole areas of neutron stars, we will present their impact on X-ray burst light curves. Furthermore, we will discuss the possibility of constraining equation of states from Clocked bursters such as GS 1826-24 and 1RXS J180408.9-342058.
