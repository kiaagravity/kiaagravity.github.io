## Prof. Shuxu Yi (IHEP)

#### Gravitational wave Universe toolbox

As the importance of gravitational wave (GW) astrophysics increases rapidly, astronomers interested in GWs who are not experts in this field sometimes need to get a quick idea of what GW sources can be detected by certain detectors, and the accuracy of the measured parameters.

The GW-Toolbox is a set of easy-to-use, flexible tools to simulate observations of the GW universe with different detectors, including ground-based interferometers (advanced LIGO, advanced VIRGO, KAGRA, Einstein Telescope, Cosmic Explorer, and also customised interferometers), space-borne interferometers (LISA and a customised design), and pulsar timing arrays mimicking the current working arrays (EPTA, PPTA, NANOGrav, IPTA) and future ones. We include a broad range of sources, such as mergers of stellar-mass compact objects, namely black holes, neutron stars, and black hole-neutron star binaries, supermassive black hole binary mergers and inspirals, Galactic double white dwarfs in ultra-compact orbit, extreme-mass-ratio inspirals, and stochastic GW backgrounds.

In this talk, I will give a throughout overview of the toolbox, including its functionalities and methodology. I will also present two recent scientific application work done with the toolbox, namely the study on the future prospects of GW astronomy on binary black hole population and sub-threshold joint observation on binary neutron star mergers as GW sources and gamma-ray bursts.
