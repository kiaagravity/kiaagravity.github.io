## Group Meeting

**Chair**: Ziming Wang (王子铭)

Group meeting provides a friendly environment to interact with group members or
visiting scholars.  It also brings the opportunity to broaden views in science,
to learn different methods in solving problems, to strengthen the capability in
scientifically sound presentations, even to develop close collaborations via
inspiring discussions. 

- Our group meetings take place in the <b>Meeting Room in Auditorium</b> at
PKU-KIAA. To avoid conflicts with students' classes, the time is fixed to
<b>Sundays 9:00—11:30</b>.

- In each group meeting, one or two science talks will be presented. It is
suggested to speak English whenever there are foreigners in the audience.
Otherwise it is suggested to talk in Chinese, but use English in slides.
