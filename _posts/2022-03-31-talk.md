## Prof. Michael Kramer (MPIfR/Bonn)

#### Probing relativistic gravity with radio astronomy

We experience a golden era in testing and exploring relativistic gravity. Whether it is results from gravitational wave detectors, satellite or lab experiments, radio astronomy plays an important complementary role. Here one can mention the cosmic microwave background, black hole imaging and, obviously, binary pulsars. This talk will provide an overview how these methods relate to each other, and will in particular focus on new results from the study of binary pulsars, where we can test the behaviour of strongly self-gravitating bodies with unrivalled precision. The talk will also give an outlook of what we can expect from new experiments, such as MeerKAT or the SKA.
