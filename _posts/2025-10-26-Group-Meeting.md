## One talk:

#### Ziming Wang: Science Cases with Overlapping Gravitational-wave Signals

Ref. 1: [Anatomy of parameter-estimation biases in overlapping gravitational-wave signals](https://doi.org/10.1088/1361-6382/ad210b)  

Ref. 2: [Rigorous Analytic Solution to the Gravitational-wave Overlapping Event Rates](https://doi.org/10.3847/1538-4357/adfa1d)  

Ref. 3: [Anatomy of parameter-estimation biases in overlapping gravitational-wave signals: detector network](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2509.07737)

## Four rehearsals:

#### Kaiyao Chu: Gravitational wave emission from a neutron star under the pinning mechanism

#### Wenshuai Liu: Lightweight posterior construction for GW catalogs with the Kolmogorov-Arnold network

#### Yibo Yang: Testing Dark Matter Properties Near Sgr A* Using Pulsar Timing

#### Yilun Zhang: Spin Effects in Scalar-Tensor Gravity for Inspiraling Compact Binaries
