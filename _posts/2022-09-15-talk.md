## Prof. Hao Tong (Guangzhou University)

#### Magnetospheric physics of magnetars

The multiwavelength observations and theoretical modelings of magnetars are presented. Magnetars may be young neutron stars having strong magnetic field. They are different from normal pulsars mainly because their magnetic field may be twisted. A twisted magnetic field will explain the outburst, timing and radio polarization of magnetars. Possible presence of multipole field may also explain the rapid position angle variation of magnetars.
